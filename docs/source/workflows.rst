Workflows

.. automodule:: src.workflows

List of the different workflows of the pipeline.

Each has to be run for each task independently. All parameters should preferably
be changed in the `opt` structure.

See the set up section.

Slice Time Correction
=====================

.. autofunction:: bidsSTC

Performs Slice Time Correction (STC) of the functional volumes by running the script: 
``bidsSTC.m``

STC will be performed using the information provided in the BIDS data set. It
will use the mid-volume acquisition time point as as reference.

The ``getOption.m`` fields related to STC can still be used to do some slice
timing correction even no information is can be found in the BIDS data set.

In general slice order and reference slice is entered in time unit (ms) (this is
the BIDS way of doing things) instead of the slice index of the reference slice
(the "SPM" way of doing things).

Some comments from `here <http://mindhive.mit.edu/node/109>`_ on STC, when
it should be applied

*At what point in the processing stream should you use it?*

*This is the great open question about slice timing, and it's not
super-answerable. Both SPM and AFNI recommend you do it before doing
realignment/motion correction, but it's not entirely clear why. The issue is
this:*

*If you do slice timing correction before realignment, you might look down your
non-realigned time course for a given voxel on the border of gray matter and
CSF, say, and see one TR where the head moved and the voxel sampled from CSF
instead of gray. This would results in an interpolation error for that voxel, as
it would attempt to interpolate part of that big giant signal into the previous
voxel. On the other hand, if you do realignment before slice timing correction,
you might shift a voxel or a set of voxels onto a different slice, and then
you'd apply the wrong amount of slice timing correction to them when you
corrected - you'd be shifting the signal as if it had come from slice 20, say,
when it actually came from slice 19, and shouldn't be shifted as much.*

*There's no way to avoid all the error (short of doing a four-dimensional
realignment process combining spatial and temporal correction - Remi's note:
fMRIprep does it), but I believe the current thinking is that doing slice timing
first minimizes your possible error. The set of voxels subject to such an
interpolation error is small, and the interpolation into another TR will also be
small and will only affect a few TRs in the time course. By contrast, if one
realigns first, many voxels in a slice could be affected at once, and their
whole time courses will be affected. I think that's why it makes sense to do
slice timing first. That said, here's some articles from the SPM e-mail list
that comment helpfully on this subject both ways, and there are even more if you
do a search for "slice timing AND before" in the archives of the list.*

Spatial Preprocessing 
=====================

Performs spatial preprocessing by running the script: ``bidsSpatialPrepro.m``
      
.. autofunction:: bidsSpatialPrepro

Smoothing 
=========
Performs smoothing of the functional data by running the function: ``bidsSmoothing.m``

.. autofunction:: bidsSmoothing  

Subject level analysis 
======================

Performs the subject level analysis by running the ffx script: ``bidsFFX.m``.

This will run twice, once for model specification and another time for model
estimation. See the function for more details.

This will take each condition present in the ``events.tsv`` file of each run and
convolve it with a canonical HRF. It will also add the 6 realignment parameters
of every run as confound regressors.

.. autofunction:: bidsFFX  

Group level analysis
====================

Performs the group level analysis by running the RFX script: ``bidsRFX.m``

.. autofunction:: bidsRFX  

Comput results
==============

.. autofunction:: bidsResults
